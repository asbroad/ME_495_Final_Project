<a id="project-goal" class="anchor" href="#project-goal" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Project Goal</h1>

<p>The overall goal of our project was to develop a system that used the Kuka youBot to build designed structures out of building blocks.  For this project, the youBot will need to design a structure that it would like to build (e.g. a tower or a pyramid), develop a plan of how to build it and then carry out that plan.  To do so, the youBot will need to be able to navigate to a designated 'collection area' in order to pick up unused building blocks.  It will then need to use it's onboard arm to pick up and carry the building block to a designated 'building area', where it will strategically place the block based on the original plan.  The youBot will also need to be able to recognize when it has completed building it structure.</p>

<img src="images/workspace.jpg">

The workspace is a subsection of D110 in the Technological Institute.  The collection and building areas are the bottom and top of a paper ream box, respectively.  The blocks we are using to build the structures are 2"x2"x2" wood blocks.

We broke the project up into the following four parts.  The <b>State Manager</b> which will develop the design the structure and develop the plan for how to build it.  It will also manage the other nodes.  The <b>Navigation package</b> which will navigate between the collection and build areas.  It should be capable of dynamically replanning the youBot's path between the two designated areas to avoid obstacles.  The <b>Block Recognition</b> package which will locate the blocks in the building and collection areas.  It should locate each building block with high fidelity so that the robotic arm can succesfully pick up the block.  And lastly, the <b>Arm Dynamics</b> package which will pick up unused blocks and strategically place them in the structure.

<a id="nav-package" class="anchor" href="#nav-package" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Navigation Package</h3>

Use combination of ROS Nav Stack (locations defined in the map frame) and laser scan based controller to navigate workspace.

<pre><code>$ roslaunch youbot_nav_msr move_base_eband_small.launch
$ rosrun youbot_nav_msr orient_at_collection_area.py
</code></pre>
